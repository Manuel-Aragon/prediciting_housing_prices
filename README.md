# prediciting_housing_prices

Problem statement![image](https://github.com/Manuel-Aragon/prediciting_housing_prices/assets/73243037/aff34074-7459-4517-a391-91a471d48da6)

Accurately predicting house prices can be challenging due to the complex interplay of these factors. However, a reliable predictive model can provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the housing market, such as potential buyers and sellers, real estate agents, and investors. By utilizing machine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze large datasets containing historical house sales and identify patterns that can help predict future prices.

The project will use the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 
The dataset includes information on the size, location, age, quality, and condition of the houses, as well as features related to interior and exterior design, utilities, and neighborhood amenities.
